                           <p> Welcome to your life
                            There's no turning back
                            Even while we sleep
                            We will find you acting on your best behavior
                            Turn your back on Mother Nature
                            Everybody wants to rule the world.
                            It's my own design
                            It's my own remorse
                            Help me to decide
                            Help me make the most
                            Of freedom and of pleasure
                            Nothing ever lasts forever
                            Everybody wants to rule the world.
                            There's a room where the light won't find you
                            Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
                            When they do I'll be right behind you.
                            So glad we've almost made it
                            So sad they had to fade it
                            Everybody wants to rule the world.
                            I can't stand this indecision
                            Married with a lack of vision
                            Everybody wants to rule the world
                            Say that you'll never never never never need it
                            One headline why believe it?
                            Everybody wants to rule the worldrrt4ey
